# My portfolio, created for [youbayoub.com](http://youbayoub.com) by andrewborstein

Tools used to build this website :
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) - a super handy CSS framework to get Google's Material Design components and style
- And a bunch of custom CSS to get it looking just right.

## Note
- I recently removed Grunt as a build tool dependency and moved my site hosting to Netlify. All files are completely static (for the time being), but they also live in a `/public` folder instead of the root. If you don't use Netlify, feel free to move everything back into the  root folder instead.
- Make sure to set `analyticsId` to your unique GA account id inside the `Google Analytics` script tag at the bottom of the `<body>`, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
